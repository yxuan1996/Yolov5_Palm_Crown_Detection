# Yolov5_Palm_Crown_Detection
This Repository contains project files for the YoloV5 image detection model to detect the top or 'crown' of oil palm trees.

The YoloV5 documentation can be found in the official YoloV5 github repository: https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5

## Training

The code for training the palm crown detection model is contained in the `Palm Crown Detection - YoloV5 Training` jupyter notebook. 

Training can be done on any GPU-enabled computer or Google Colab (Recommended). 

The model is trained using 300 aerial palm crown images, taken from using a DJI Mavic Air 2 Drone.
